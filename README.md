# Learn C With Me - an AI-built course to learn C with a security focus. 

## Introduction

Welcome to my **Learn C Programming** course! This course is designed to help me (and anyone interested) dive deep into the C programming language with a practical, security-focused end goal. It’s built to enhance my foundational understanding of C, starting from the basics and moving toward more complex topics that are critical for systems programming and security-related tasks.

## Why (A)I Made This Course

I’m passionate about security and understanding the low-level details of how systems work. Learning C is crucial because it gives you the power to interact with memory, understand how the operating system works, and create efficient programs. Since I wanted to enhance my skills with a practical focus, I asked AI to help me design this course specifically tailored to my needs.

This journey is more than just learning syntax; it’s about learning to think like a systems programmer and security expert. Whether it’s managing memory safely, writing optimized code, or understanding potential vulnerabilities in code, this course will take me through the steps to build that knowledge.

## What You’ll Find Here

The repository is divided into modules that progressively teach C concepts, starting with the fundamentals and advancing toward more complex topics like pointers, memory management, and system-level programming.

Each module includes:

- **Concept explanations**: Written sections or comments that explain the topic at hand.
- **Practical exercises**: C files where I write code to practice what I’ve learned.
- **My Answers**: As I complete this course, you will see the soltuions section being filled out with my answers.
